# Sort Integers

This kata is an implementation of the sorting algorithm, specficcally quick sort. A good exercise when practicing this kata is to explore the possible solutions to the first real sort test (`[2,1]` -> `[1,2]`). Depending on the method chosen to solve this test, you will either arrive at bubble sort, or some other sorting implmentation like quick sort. This is a good demonstration of how the chocies a developer makes during TDD cycles can have a drastic effect on the outcome of an algorithm.
