# Katas

## Practice Your TDD/BDD/ATDD Skills

### What is a Kata?

A kata is a fast paced method of practicing software development skills,
based on ideologies borrowed from martial arts. For more information
checkout out this [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)).

### What is TDD/BDD?ATDD?

These are mental frameworks with the end goal of producing stable, readable,
extensible, and modular software. For more info, read some wikis:
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development),
[BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development),
[ATDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_test%E2%80%93driven_development).

### Contribute!

This repo can and should be home to all manner of programming languages.
Feel free to contribute a kata and place it in the appropriate folder via
a PR.

Make sure you follow this convention:

```
<root-folder>
   |
   - <language>
     |
     - <kata-name>
```

You should be able to follow examples for each language by looking at an existing one.
We try to name things in a good way, so please stick to sane conventions that
are reproducible across other katas.

The easiest way to do that is to pull the `_blank` project inside the folder of your
language of choice and roll that way. If a template doesn't exist, make one and submit
it!

Have fun!
